# Python 3: The Complete Beginner's Course
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=python_lesson_plan.html" />

This repository contains a simple, step-by-step lesson plan designed to teach a complete beginner the fundamentals of Python 3. The course is structured for a one-on-one teaching environment and focuses on making core concepts easy to understand through simple analogies and practical exercises.

I've made this available to the community in the hope that it will help others learn or teach Python, as I believe that learning should be a free resource for all to enjoy.

# âœ¨ Features
Teacher Scripts: Each lesson includes a conversational script for you to read aloud, making it easy to present complex ideas in a simple, friendly way.

Building Project: A single, continuous project (my_project.py) that grows with each lesson, allowing the student to see how all the concepts fit together to create a working program.

Debugging Practice: A "Common Mistakes" section in each lesson presents a small, buggy code snippet related to the previous topic, helping the student practice a crucial programming skill.

Hands-On Exercises: Standalone "Your Turn" tasks at the end of each lesson provide a chance to practice new concepts immediately.

Clear Structure: The entire course is laid out in a single, well-organized HTML file, making it easy to navigate and follow.
